# Booktracker

## About

Booktracker is an improved version of an old project of mine, Booktrackerlite.  The goal of this project was to create a NextJS frontend, and familiarize myself with the framework.  The application is structured within a mono repository, meaning both the Backend (Springboot) and Frontend (NextJS) are located within the same directory.

- NextJS frontend
- Shadcn integration
- Postgresql database
- Springboot Rest API on the backend
- Utilizes custom API from my [easybooks-api](https://github.com/hfish063/easybooks-api) project to generate book details
- Lightweight and easy to run on your local machine

## Running the Application

Before running the application, it is important to ensure that all `Environment` variables are properly configured.  See the `.env.example` files for more information on this.
