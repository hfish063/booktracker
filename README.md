# Booktracker

## About

Booktracker is an improved version of an old project of mine, Booktrackerlite.  The goal of this project was to create a NextJS frontend, and familiarize myself with the framework.  The application is structured within a mono repository, meaning both the Backend (Springboot) and Frontend (NextJS) are located within the same directory.

## Running the Application

Before running the application, it is important to ensure that all `Environment` variables are properly configured.  See the `.env.example` files for more information on this.
